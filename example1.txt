// River A flows through Dam A and joins River B to form River C
// River C joins with River D to make the output river


// Initially:
// River A: 2.0x
// River B: 1.5x
// River C: 5.1x
// River D: 4.1x
// Output River: 8.2x

// C = 5.1x ~~ (A ~~ B) 
// Output = 8.2x ~~ (4.1x ~~ (5.1x ~~ (A ~~ B) ))
//	= 8.2x ~~ (4.1x ~~ (5.1x ~~ (2.0x ~~ 1.5x) ))

8.2x ~~ (4.1x ~~ (5.1x ~~ (2.0x ~~ 1.5x) ))
